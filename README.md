# Password Generator 

## Purpose:

As a coding bootcamp student, I created a tool to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria so that I can create a strong password that provides greater security. 

## Acceptance Criteria:

GIVEN I need a new, secure password

- WHEN I click the button to generate a password
  - THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria

- WHEN prompted for password criteria
  - THEN I select which criteria to include in the password

- WHEN prompted for the length of the password
  - THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters

- WHEN asked for character types to include in the password
  - THEN I confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters

- WHEN I answer each prompt
  - THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected

- WHEN all prompts are answered
  - THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria

- WHEN the password is generated
  - THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page
